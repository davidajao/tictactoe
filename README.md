I tested it using expo-cli

Assumptions: 
1.  Players take turns and X always starts
2.  You can restart the game at any point in time
3.  A player wins when they have three pieces on the same row, column, or diagonal
4.  The game stops when all cells are filled
5.  The game stops when a player wins


Constraints:
1.  You cannot play in a cell that is already full
